INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP:
Social entrepreneurship is a business model that combines profit-making with a social or environmental
mission. Social entrepreneurs are individuals or organizations that aim to address and solve social
problems while also generating sustainable revenue. These ventures often employ innovative
approaches and creative solutions to tackle issues such as poverty, healthcare, education, environmental
sustainability, and more.
Social entrepreneurship goes beyond traditional philanthropy by focusing on self-sustainability and
creating a positive impact through business activities. Successful social enterprises not only achieve
financial sustainability but also create lasting social change. They work towards a "double bottom line"
— both financial and social impact.
Case Study 1: Successful Startup in Computing (Indian Startup)
Startup: Zoho Corporation
Overview: Zoho Corporation is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company headquartered in Chennai,
India. It offers a suite of cloud-based applications for businesses, including customer relationship
management (CRM), email, project management, and more. Zoho has achieved global success, serving
millions of users worldwide.
Social Impact: Zoho is known for its commitment to providing affordable and accessible software
solutions to small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) around the world. By offering a range of free or
low-cost tools, Zoho empowers SMBs to enhance their productivity and competitiveness. This has a
significant social impact by helping businesses thrive and create employment opportunities in their
communities.
Case Study 2: Failed Startup in Computing (Global Startup)
Startup: Kozmo.com
Overview: Kozmo.com was an early 2000s startup that aimed to provide on-demand delivery of DVDs,
videos, and snacks to customers' doorsteps. It raised substantial funding and grew rapidly but ultimately
failed during the dot-com bubble burst.
Social Impact Analysis: While Kozmo.com initially gained popularity and attracted a user base, it was
unable to achieve long-term financial sustainability. The company's social impact was limited due to its
business model, which focused more on convenience than addressing significant social issues. The
failure of Kozmo.com demonstrates the importance of both a viable business model and a meaningful
social mission in the context of social entrepreneurship.
Case Study 3: Student-Led Startup in Computing (Global Startup)

Startup: Dropbox
Overview: Dropbox is a widely known cloud storage and file-sharing service. It was founded by Drew
Houston, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Arash Ferdowsi in 2007.
Dropbox simplifies the way people store and share their documents, photos, and other digital files.
Social Impact: Dropbox has had a substantial social impact by making it easier for individuals and
businesses to store and share data. It has enhanced productivity, collaboration, and data accessibility,
benefiting a broad user base. While not explicitly a social enterprise, Dropbox has positively impacted
the way people work and share information.
These case studies illustrate the diverse nature of startups in the computing sector, including those with
clear social missions, those that failed due to a lack of sustainability, and those founded by students with
global reach. Social entrepreneurship can take various forms, and its success often depends on a
combination of innovation, commitment to a social mission, and effective business execution.
